			<font face="Verdana" size="3">A true jewel on the West Coast of Peninsular Malaysia, <b><i><u>Pangkor Island Hotel</u></i></b> is the perfect getaway 
			from the metropolitan life to rest, relax and rejuvenate. Located between Penang and Kuala Lumpur, the 
			journey from the country's capital takes only about 3 hours to the coastal town of Lumut, either by car 
			or limousine coach, the scenic landscape is an experience by itself.
			From Lumut, a short 30 minutes ferry journey in the calm waters of the strait, leads to the hotel's 
			private jetty. Surrounded by hills of virgin rain forest, sitting on a secluded and privately own 
			bay over a 1.2 km stretch of white sandy beach on the warm and clean Andaman sea, sheltered by 
			the north end of Sumatra Island, this is your private get-away. Except for some occasional showers, 
			the hotel promised year round sunshine and the sensation to be in a corner of the Eden's garden.</font>
